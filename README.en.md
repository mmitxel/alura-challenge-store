# 🏬 Alura Store Challenge

**Data Science** challenge for the **ONE (Oracle Next Education)** program by **Alura Latam**.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To apply initial data analysis concepts in **Python**, using native libraries for data manipulation, extraction, and visualization.

---

## 🧩 The Challenge

Help **Sr. Juan** decide **which of his Alura Store branches should be sold** to fund a new business venture.  
To do this, data on sales, performance, and customer reviews from **four stores** of Alura Store were analyzed.  

The goal is to identify the **least efficient store** and present a **data-driven recommendation**.

---

## ⚙️ Methodology

1. Review the available data structure and extract relevant information using **Pandas**.  
2. Organize data into a format suitable for manipulation and analysis.  
3. Plot the obtained values and metrics using clear, intuitive visualizations with **Matplotlib**.  
4. Conduct an in-depth analysis comparing **quantitative metrics** (sales, shipping costs, ratings) and **qualitative factors** (product categories).  
5. Derive conclusions directly from the data and present them in a **final report**.

## 📊 Final Report

An analysis of metrics from the four stores was conducted to determine which one would be the most convenient to sell.  
Both sales and customer satisfaction variables were evaluated, along with those that influence commercial strategies.

Store **number four** showed a clear **disadvantage** compared to the others due to its **lower profitability**, despite having some strategic advantages.

### 🔹 Total Revenue

Its **total revenue** is significantly lower than that of the other stores:  
only **1,308.4 million colombian pesos (COP)**, compared to **1,150.9**, **1,116.3**, and **1,098.0** million COP for the others _(Figure 1)_.  
This represents a difference ranging from **6% to 11%** _(Figure 2)_.

### 🔹 Shipping Costs

The fourth store has **lower average shipping costs** than the others _(Figure 3)_,  
yet this **has not translated into higher sales**, as one might expect.

### 🔹 Product Categories

Stores **3 and 4** show different product category distributions compared to Stores 1 and 2:  
- In **Store 3**, **books** sales surpass those of **musical instruments**.  
- In **Store 4**, **home goods** sales exceed both categories,  
  and more importantly, sales of **sports & recreation** goods surpass those of **appliances**,  
  which doesn’t happen in the other stores _(Figure 4)_.  

This means that any marketing strategy (discounts, promotions, campaigns) must take these differences of store number 4 into account,  
potentially **complicating implementation and reducing overall effectiveness**.

### 🔹 Customer Ratings

Customer ratings show no significant differences:  
all stores range **between 3.98 and 4.05** _(Figure 5)_,  
so this factor **does not affect the decision** one way or the other.

---

### 🧾 Conclusion

> It is recommended to **sell Store 4**  
> due to its **lower profitability and competitive disadvantage**.
